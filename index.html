    <!-- Question 3 answered here -->
    
    <p>Hello, my name is Molly Barnes. I'm a first year <strong>computer science</strong> intended major.
    I chose this major because code is very intersting a cool to me. 
    I didn't have much experience before but I am already learning so many new skills!
    It is very challenging but I'm excited to see where it takes me in life.
    </p> 
    <br />


    <p> I do not have a job right now, but I worked for about two years in high school.
    I worked at the grocery store <em>Ingles</em> as a cashier. I enjoyed this job and ended up getting a scholarship from the company!
    Over winter break I worked with a local textile business, <ins>The High Fiber</ins>, in ASheville, NC. 
    I helped fold and package orders for their handmade screen printed towels.
    </p>
